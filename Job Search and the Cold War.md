# An Escalating weapons race between applicants and Applicant Tracking Systems (ATSs)

## Disclaimer: *This is specifically true to my personal experience in the IT fields, especially programming.* *I do not know* *how true it may be for other career paths.*
## **Note:** The writer is aware of the irony of anthropomorphizing programs (ATSs) that are created by humans to track equally human job applicants.

- First there were keywords that the ATSs relied on. Applicants started putting in keywords into their project descriptions. 
  - Advantage applicants.
- Then ATSs moved to counting the number of times keywords appeared in a document so applicants started putting them in hidden and non-printable text. Humans could not see them but the text was not hidden from the ATSs. 
  - Advantage applicants.
- The ATSs retaliated by discounting hidden keywords.  Applicants started putting them in each project whether they were relevant or not. 
  - Advantage applicants again.
- ATSs started looking for key phrases. Applicants countered by adding those to their project descriptions and wherever else they could. 
  - Advantage applicants yet again.
- With that, the ATSs started using a weighted approach to key words & key phrases by where they occurred in the document (close to the top of the document for paragraphs got more weighted, and in terms of tables, closer to the left hand columns of the table and closer to the top row of the tables). Applicants retaliated by putting key words and key phrases as close to the top of the document as possible as well as in their project descriptions. 
  - Advantage applicants again.
- ATSs amped up the weapons race by using a weighted ranking of key words/key phrases by the position of a in the list of projects within a resume. Older projects did not retain their weight per key word/key phrase as before. So applicants started putting in the keywords and key phrases within each project description, but because ATSs had learned the hidden text trick and the non-relevance trick, they had to have actually done the work on each project. 
  - Advantage ATS. Finally!
- ATSs tried pressing their advantage by also using weighted rankings, by how many times the key words and key phrases occurred within a specific project description as well as overall within the document. Applicants reacted by repeating keywords as often as possible for resumes that went into an ATS even if it interfered with human readability of those resumes. They also kept a resume version that was far more human-readable without all the unnecessary repetition of key words and key phrases. 
  - Advantage back to applicants. Humans are generic problem solvers with their competency honed by evolution!
- ATSs reacted to *that* by requiring that all resumes that screeners, recruiters and interviewers used come only from the ATS. The applicants upped the ante by crafting resumes that balanced repetition of keywords for ATSs with human readability. 
  - Again, advantage applicants.
- ATSs on their part again upped the ante by checking the appearances of these key words and key phrases not just within the placement of a project in the document but also the placement of the keywords and key phrases within project descriptions. The key words and key phrases occurring in the first few lines of a project description were weighted higher than those occurring in the 3rd and lower lines of a project description. Applicants adjusted by putting in as many repetitions as would not turn off a human reviewer but also worked to repeat enough times for an ATS to possibly put them into the top of a stack for actual human reviewers. 
  - Advantage back to ATSs for now.

This as far as my knowledge goes, true to my experience back in early 2019. ATSs have continued to press their advantage by upgrading to Artificial Intelligences (AI). The problem with AIs in general is that they are programmed by members of the currently dominant culture that disadvantages people from other cultures and sub-cultures. This perpetrates these unfair societal dynamics and even risks ossifying them and continue to disadvantage others well into the future. No doubt yet other events have occurred in the meantime that have advanced this weapons race further.
