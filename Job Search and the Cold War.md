# Escalating weapons race between applicants and Applicant Tracking Systems

## **Job Applications - the Cold War: An escalating weapons race between applicants and ATSs**
- First, there were keywords that the ATSs relied on. Applicants started putting in keywords into their project descriptions. 
  - Advantage applicants.
- Then ATSs moved to counting the number of times keywords appeared in a document, so applicants started putting them in hidden and non-printable text. Humans couldn’t see them, but the text wasn’t hidden from the ATSs. 
  - Advantage applicants.
- The ATSs retaliated by discounting hidden keywords.  Applicants started putting them in each project whether they were relevant or not. 
  - Advantage applicants, again.
- ATSs started looking for key phrases. Applicants countered by adding those to their project descriptions and wherever else they could. 
  - Advantage applicants, yet again.
- With that, the ATSs started using a weighted approach to key words & key phrases, by where they occurred in the document (close to the top of the document for paragraphs got more weighted, and in terms of tables, closer to the left hand columns of the table and closer to the top row of the tables). Applicants retaliated by putting key words and key phrases as close to the top of the document as possible as well as in their project descriptions. 
  - Advantage applicants again.
- ATSs amped up the weapons race by using a weighted ranking of key words/key phrases by their projects’ position in the list of projects within a resume. Older projects didn’t receive as many points per key word/key phrase as before. So applicants started putting in the keywords and key phrases within each project description, but because ATSs had learned the hidden text trick and the non-relevance trick, they had to have actually done the work on each project. 
  - Advantage ATS. Finally!
- ATSs tried pressing their advantage by also using weighted rankings, by how many times the key words and key phrases occurred within a specific project description as well as overall within the document. Applicants reacted by repeating keywords all over the place, for resumes that went into an ATS. But they also kept a resume version that was far more human-readable, without all the unnecessary repetition of key words and key phrases. 
  - Advantage back to applicants. Humans are generic problem solvers with their competency honed by evolution!
- ATSs reacted to *that* by requiring that all resumes that screeners, recruiters and interviewers used come only from the ATS. The applicants upped the ante by crafting resumes that balanced repetition of keywords for ATSs with human readability. 
  - Again, advantage applicants.
- ATSs on their part, upped the ante by checking the key words’ and key phrases’ appearances not just within a project’s placement in the document, but also the placement of the keywords and key phrases within project descriptions. The key words and key phrases occurring in the first few lines of a project description were weighted higher than those occurring in the 3rd and lower lines of a project description. Applicants adjusted by putting in as many repetitions as wouldn’t turn off a human reviewer but also worked to repeat enough times for an ATS to possibly put them into the top of a stack. 
  - Advantage back to ATS, for now.

And this as far as my knowledge goes. This was last year. No doubt other events have occurred in the meantime that have advanced this weapons race further.
